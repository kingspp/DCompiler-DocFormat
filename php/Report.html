<p>Abstract-This electronic document is a “live” template and already defines the components of your paper [title, text, heads, etc.] in its style sheet.  *CRITICAL:  Do Not Use Symbols, Special Characters, or Math in Paper Title or Abstract. (Abstract)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This template, modified in MS Word 2007 and saved as  a “Word 97-2003 Document” for the PC, provides authors with most of the formatting specifications needed for preparing electronic versions of their papers. All standard paper components have been specified for three reasons: (1) ease of use when formatting individual papers, (2) automatic compliance to electronic requirements that facilitate the concurrent or later production of electronic products, and (3) conformity of style throughout a conference proceedings. Margins, column widths, line spacing, and type styles are built-in; examples of the type styles are provided throughout this document and are identified in italic type, within parentheses, following the example. Some components, such as multi-leveled equations, graphics, and tables are not prescribed, although the various table text styles are provided. The formatter will need to create these components, incorporating the applicable criteria that follow.</p>

<p>Acknowledgment</p>
<p>The preferred spelling of the word “acknowledgment” in America is without an “e” after the “g.” Avoid the stilted expression “one of us (R. B. G.) thanks ...”.  Instead, try “R. B. G. thanks...”. Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>References</p>
<p>The template will number citations consecutively within brackets [1]. The sentence punctuation follows the bracket [2]. Refer simply to the reference number, as in [3]—do not use “Ref. [3]” or “reference [3]” except at the beginning of a sentence: “Reference [3] was the first ...”
Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.
Unless there are six authors or more give all authors’ names; do not use “et al.”. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been submitted for publication, should be cited as “unpublished” [4]. Papers that have been accepted for publication should be cited as “in press” [5]. Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and element symbols.
For papers published in translation journals, please give the English citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation [6].
